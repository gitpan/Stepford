=head1 NAME

Stepford::Role::Step::FileGenerator::Atomic - A role for steps that generate a file atomically

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002009

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role consumes the L<Stepford::Role::Step::FileGenerator> role. It allows
only one file production, but makes sure it is written atomically - the file
will not exist if the step aborts. The file will only be committed to its
final destination when C<run()> completes successfully.

Instead of manipulating the file production directly, you work with the file
given by C<$step->pre_commit_file()>. This role will make sure it gets
committed after C<run()>.

=head1 METHODS

This role provides the following methods:

=head2 $step->BUILD()

This method adds a wrapper to the BUILD method which ensures that there is
only one production.

=head2 $step->pre_commit_file()

This returns a temporary file in a temporary directory that you can manipulate
inside C<run()>. It will be removed if the step fails, or renamed to the final
file production if the step succeeds.

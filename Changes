* Breaking API changes. Final step(s) are now passed to the $planner->run()
  method rather than the Stepford::Planner constructor.

- Implemented the ability to specify multiple final steps for a run.

- Implemented parallel running.

- All runs now end with a new step, Stepford::FinalStep. This just logs a
  message saying that the run is complete.

- Plans are now optimized so steps run as early as possible in the plan. This
  helps improve parallelism and is just more generally correct. Thanks to Ran
  Eilam for pointing me at a blog post
  (blog.codeaholics.org/parallel-ant/#how-it-works) that described a very
  simple algorithm to do this.

- Require Time::HiRes 1.9726. Some earlier versions broke constructs like
  (stat $file)[9]. This construct is used in the Stepford::Role::FileGenerator
  role.

- (Hopefully) Fix some test failures that look they're caused by hash
  randomization. Reported by Slaven Rezic. GitHub issue #1.

- Totally redesigned the whole thing after discussions with Greg Oschwald here
  at MaxMind. I did say this was alpha!

- The tests now require Time::HiRes 1.9722. It seems like the version shipped
  before Perl 5.16 (1.9721_01) has a weird bug when used like this:

      some_sub( (stat $file)[9] );

  It seems to return the value "9" rather than the mtime.

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
